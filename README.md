# Palmer Penguins Classification Project

## Overview
This project uses the Palmer Penguins dataset to classify penguin species based on their physical characteristics such as bill length, bill depth, and flipper length. It demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques for classification problems.

## Dataset
The dataset is publicly available and was obtained via the UC Irvine ML Repository at {https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/690/palmer+penguins-3} and contains measurements of three penguin species from the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica.

## Tools and Techniques
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning Techniques (Decision Tree, KNN)
- Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

## Results
Achieved an accuracy of 94% using the Decision Tree classifier.
Achieved an accuracy of 82% using the KNN.
